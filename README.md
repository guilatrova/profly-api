Applications powered by [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to scrap data, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[Graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) for the API, and Cognito to authenticate.

### Purpose

The purpose is to track how much I invested in which stocks (USA and Brazil) and track my emotions as I take actions so I can finetune my decisions, understand why I did what I did, and ultimately learn from my own mistakes.
